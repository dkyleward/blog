<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In my article on <a href="/2019/11/15/choosing-school-wake-county">choosing a school in Wake
County</a>, I used
<a href="https://ncdpi.sas.com/">EVAAS</a> growth scores along with
<a href="https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/state-tests/end-grade-eog">EOGs</a>
to prioritize schools for my son. At the time, I could find little documentation
on EVAAS and decided to put more emphasis on the EOG scores.</p>
<p>Since then, more digging turned up this <a href="https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/whitepaper1/sas-evaas-k12-statistical-models-107411.pdf">white
paper</a>
from SAS. The white paper outlines the model form and explains how certain
metrics are generated. There are enough formulas to scare off laypeople, but
their fixed effects matrix is not published for statisticians. In short, the
model remains a black box. (Bonus: for a better intro to mixed linear models
like EVAAS, see <a href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/introduction-to-linear-mixed-models/">this
one</a>
from UCLA. It uses doctors/patients rather than teachers/students but is otherwise
the same.)</p>
<p>While reverse-engineering the model is impossible, I decided to investigate the
results for potential bias.</p>

<h2>Investigating EVAAS</h2>
<p>Imagine someone claimed to have a cube, but they wouldn’t let you examine it
first hand. Instead, you could only see pictures of the six sides (top, bottom,
left, right, front, and back). You would expect each of those pictures to look
like squares. If they didn’t, you would know it wasn’t a cube.</p>
<p>SAS claims the EVAAS model is a robust measure of achievement for teachers,
schools, and districts. Importantly, it is supposed to account for things like
race, socio-economic status and district by tracking the same children over
time. We can’t see the model, but we can look at the results from several angles
to investigate their claims.</p>
<p>The chart below provides one angle. Each dot is a school. Its position is based
on its EVAAS growth score (y-axis) and the percent of Asian students attending
(x-axis). If the test was fair, the dots should be randomly scattered around a
growth index of 0. Instead, schools tend to get better EVAAS scores as the
percent of Asian students increases.</p>

<p>This method of investigation isn’t conclusive. It is possible that the test is
fair, but that Asian parents favor (and can afford) areas within school
districts that have better schools. Even so, the growth expectations for Asian
students <em>should</em> (in a fair model) adjust over time to account for this.</p>
<p>The chart below plots EVAAS scores compared to the percent of Black students at
each school. It shows a troubling trend in the opposite direction. Schools with
more Black students receive noticeably lower EVAAS scores.</p>

<p>These findings are consistent with an analysis of the Houston Independent School
District published in the education journal Phi Delta Kappan
(<a href="https://kappanonline.org/sizzle-no-steak-value-added-model-doesnt-add-value-houston/">link</a>).
The authors had access to individual teacher scores, and they found that teacher
scores were correlated with race and subject matter. While the article takes a
strong anti-EVAAS position, it also points out that there are competing
interpretations for these findings.</p>
<p>The charts below are included primarily for completeness. They show the EVAAS
scores along all the dimensions I have access to. Each plot is like looking
at one side of the EVAAS model “cube”.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>SAS claims the EVAAS model is fair because student growth expectations account
for factors like race and school district. Instead, scores are still
correlated along racial and economic dimensions. While this doesn’t prove the
model is unfair, teachers and schools with large disadvantaged populations
should expect more transparency from a system that claims to grade their value.</p>
