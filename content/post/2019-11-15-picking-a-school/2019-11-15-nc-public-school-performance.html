<p>My oldest is entering Kindergarten next year, and I want to answer two big
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the best public schools he can attend?</li>
<li>Are private options worth the cost?</li>
</ul>
<p>What follows in this article is my dive into the deep end of school performance
metrics and how I use them to make a (hopefully) informed decision. Of course,
the choice of school depends on more than test scores, but they are a critical
consideration.</p>
<p>It is also my hope that this post introduces helpful resources to others going
through the same process. All of my sources and data are listed at the bottom.</p>
<div id="two-main-testing-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>Two main testing metrics</h2>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://ncreportcards.ondemand.sas.com/src/?viewSelect=county&amp;year=2018&amp;type=Both&amp;level=All&amp;district=410&amp;lng=en&amp;currpage=1&amp;county=wake">report
cards</a>
prepared for Wake County Public Schools, you’ll see that they each have two
metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A performance score
<ul>
<li>Measured by End of Grade tests (EOG)</li>
<li>Represented by the letter grade of the school.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A growth score
<ul>
<li>Measured by the Education Value-Added Assessment System (EVAAS)</li>
<li>Represented by the color of the school</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/2019-11-15-picking-a-school/example_report_card.png" /></p>
<p>I’m familiar with the EOG tests. I took them as a kid, and the letter grade for
each school is a pretty straight-forward measure to interpret. An “A” means that
kids got a lot of questions right and a “D” means they didn’t.</p>
<p>The growth score is new to me, but given how prominent the color of the school
is compared to its letter grade, it seems important.</p>
<div id="should-i-consider-growth-scores" class="section level3">
<h3>Should I consider growth scores?</h3>
<p>Student growth appears to be a better measure than just performance. Consider
two third-grade teachers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teacher A
<ul>
<li>Starts with a class of children reading at a first-grade level.</li>
<li>At year-end, they are reading at a third-grade level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Teacher B
<ul>
<li>Starts with a class of children reading at a fourth-grade level.</li>
<li>At year-end, they are still reading at a fourth-grade level.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the EOG exam, Teacher B looks better because her children can read at a
higher level. Looking at student growth reveals that Teacher A is doing a
better job.</p>
<p>The goal of EVAAS and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_modeling">value-added
modeling</a> is to isolate the
role of the teacher in student learning and control for things like socio-economic
status or previous competency level. For a given student, EVAAS makes a growth
prediction based on various factors. How the student performs compared to this
prediction is the growth score.</p>
<p>The scatter plot below compares school EOG and growth scores. It includes all
schools in Wake County that offer elementary grades. Along the x-axis is the
percent of students that scored at or above level four on the EOG (College and
Career Ready or CCR). The y-axis shows the growth index where scores between -2
and 2 mean that students were learning at the expected rate. Schools above 2
exceeded growth expectations while schools below 2 fell short.</p>

<p>The relationship between the two test scores is represented by the dashed
blue line, but it isn’t very strong (R<sup>2</sup> = .12). It suggests there is
only a minor relationship between performance and growth, which is
counter-intuitive to me. It may be right but warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am unable to find more than vague references to how the EVAAS
scores are calculated. I can’t find a statistical model or published
documentation from SAS (creators of EVAAS). I asked a teacher friend of mine and
quickly learned that I wasn’t the only one. Teachers are in the dark like
everyone else, and they aren’t happy about it.</p>
<p>I am wary of undocumented statistical models. Perhaps there is validation
work I’ve not seen demonstrating that the models can be trusted, but I decided
to put more weight on the EOG scores and use the EVAAS system as a secondary
point of reference.</p>

<h3>Data on private schools</h3>
<p>Another thing I learned was that the EOG and EVAAS don’t apply to private
schools, which complicates comparisons. Private schools are required to do
yearly testing, and the private schools I contacted all use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Assessments">Iowa Test of
Basic Skills</a> (ITBS).
Unfortunately, I could not find a public database of scores, and instead
requested them directly from select schools. I also discovered the <a href="(https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/)">National
Assessment of Educational Progress</a>
(NAEP), which is administered to both
private and public schools in fourth, eighth and twelfth grades, but viewing
data by school requires a license.</p>

<div id="school-demographics" class="section level2">
<h2>School demographics</h2>
<p>The test scores in the scatter plot above are performance measures for the
schools in aggregate. Several studies, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pubs/studies/2006461.asp">including one using the NAEP
data</a>, suggest
that achievement differences between schools are due more to demographic
differences than anything else. This may justify the weak relationship between
EVAAS and EOG scores. It does mean that school composition is critical.
Several online sources show the demographics of individual
schools (<a href="https://www.greatschools.org/">example</a>), but I found it helpful to
map the data to see many at once.</p>

<h2>Breaking down test scores</h2>
<p>The school demographics are very different, which limits the usefulness of
aggregate school metrics. What I need is to compare students from similar
groups between schools.</p>
<p>Before breaking down test scores further, I narrowed the list of schools to
those near my home. While we can attend any charter or private school,
proximity makes the daily routine much more convenient and allows me to be more
active in the school.</p>
<p>These are the schools I investigated in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penny Road (public - our traditional calendar option)</li>
<li>Oak Grove (public - our year-round option)</li>
<li>Peak Charter (public - charter)</li>
<li>Thales Academy (private)</li>
<li>Resurrection Lutheran (private)</li>
</ul>
<div id="public-options" class="section level3">
<h3>Public options</h3>
<p>First, it is helpful to see where the public schools fall on the scatter chart
from earlier.</p>

<p>Peak Charter outperformed Penny Road and Oak Grove in both EOG and EVAAS scores.
Based on this plot (and my preference for EOG over EVAAS), my initial ranking
of public options was:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Peak Charter</li>
<li>Penny Road</li>
<li>Oak Grove</li>
</ol>
<p>From the maps above, I know that Peak Charter has a lower percentage of students
that qualify for free lunch and a different racial mix. Does this explain the
performance difference? The chart below breaks down the EOG scores by school and
student subgroup. In short, every subgroup (including economically
disadvantaged) scored better at Peak Charter. The exception was white students,
but the difference in their performance is small compared to how well they score
at all three schools.</p>

<p>The second chart shows the EVAAS growth index broken down in the same manner.
While I decided to put less emphasis on it, it is worth a review. Peak is the
clear winner here, too.</p>

<p>The detailed scores do not change my initial ranking of public options.</p>

<h3>Private options</h3>
<p>Thales provided their 2018 ITBS scores. Kindergartners scored better than 94% of
the students nationwide while fifth-graders scored better than 82%. The decline
is concerning, but there could be several explanations (e.g. new students
joining Thales in later grades that are behind).</p>
<p>Resurrection Lutheran did not provide detailed scores, but they did provide a
copy of their letter to parents from 2018. Their students did very well,
with most classes scoring at 90% or above.</p>

<div id="comparing-public-and-private" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparing public and private</h2>
<p>The easy decision is to select Peak Charter Academy as my preferred public
option. Of course, admission to Peak is done by lottery, so it isn’t
guaranteed.</p>
<p>It is harder to answer the second question: if private schools are worth the
money. It is impossible to compare private and public directly given the
different tests used.</p>
<p>While researching the history of testing in NC, I realized the ITBS was used for
public schools by North Carolina until the 2001-2002 school year. While private
schools are still required to do yearly testing, they stopped for public
schools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) will be eliminated from the North Carolina
state testing program beginning in the 2001-02 school year. The basis of this
decision by the North Carolina State Board of Education was two-fold: (1) to
allay public concern regarding excessive testing and (2) to accommodate pressing
budgetary constraints. (<a href="http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/reporting/SOS/2001/Report.pdf">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure 13 from the same report shows the ITBS scores from 1996-2001.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2019-11-15-picking-a-school/historical_nc_itbs_scores.png" /></p>
<p>These scores aren’t encouraging, but it’s important to remember that they are
statewide scores (and old). Based on my research, I expect the scores from Wake
County to be higher than the state average and the scores for Apex schools to be
higher than the average for Wake County. Still, guessing where they would score
today is no simple task.</p>
<p>The private schools certainly had high ITBS scores in 2018, but their attendance
is heavily skewed toward Asian and White students. These are the
highest-performing demographic groups across the county. It is hard to say how
much of the private ITBS scores are due to simple demographics.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>None of our schools look like bad options, and we will tour them
all. As of this moment, my top choice is Peak Charter. If we win the lottery, it
makes the decision easy. If we don’t win, then deciding between Penny Road and
Resurrection Lutheran will be difficult. It will likely come down to school
culture, personal preferences, and whether or not we can afford tuition.</p>

<p>Every public school (non-charter) in Wake County has a School Improvement Plan
(SIP) that you can view online. This is a candid, introspective look by the
school at what they need to do to improve. The links below provide the login
information to view that school’s SIP on a system called Indistar.</p>
