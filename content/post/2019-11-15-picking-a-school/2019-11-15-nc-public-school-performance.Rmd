My oldest is entering Kindergarten next year, and I wanted to answer two big
questions:

  * What are the best public schools he can attend?
  * Are the private options worth the cost?

What follows in this article is my dive into the deep end of school performance
metrics and how I used them to make an informed decision (hopefully). Of course,
the choice of school depends on a lot more than test scores, but they were an
important part of my decision.

It is also my hope that this post introduces helpful resources to others making
the same choice.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Test Scores ##

growth_csv <- here(
  "static", "data", "2019-11-15-picking-a-school", "test_results",
  "school_growth.zip"
)
growth_tbl <- read_csv(growth_csv) %>%
  select(
    ID = `School Code`,
    board = `State Board Region`,
    district = `District Name`,
    school = `School Name`,
    grade = `Grade Span`,
    subgroup = Subgroup,
    growth_type = `School Growth Type`,
    growth_status = `School Growth Status`,
    growth_index = `School Growth Index Score`
  )
eog_csv <- here(
  "static", "data", "2019-11-15-picking-a-school", "test_results",
  "combined_eog.zip"
)
eog_tbl <- read_csv(eog_csv) %>%
  select(
    ID = `School\nCode`,
    district = `District Name`,
    school = `School Name`,
    subgroup = Subgroup,
    grade = Subject,
    pct_4 = `Percent\nLevel 4 and Above\n(CCR)`
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pct_4 = ifelse(pct_4 == ">95", 95, pct_4),
    pct_4 = ifelse(pct_4 == "<5", 5, pct_4),
    pct_4 = as.numeric(pct_4)
  )


  ## Shapefiles ##

# I downloaded the public school shapefile here:
# https://data-nconemap.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/public-schools
# It does not include charter schools.
public_file <- here(
  "static", "data", "2019-11-15-picking-a-school", "public_school_shapefile",
  "Public_Schools.shp"
)
public_shp <- st_read(public_file, quiet = TRUE) %>%
  filter(COUNTY == "Wake") %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%
  mutate(
    ID = as.numeric(LEA_SCHOOL),
    Type = "Public"
  )

# Charter shapefile
# I downloaded a list of charter schools and addresses from here:
# http://www.ncpublicschools.org/charterschools/schools/
# I geocoded them into the shapefile you see in the repo.
charter_file <- here(
  "static", "data", "2019-11-15-picking-a-school", "charter_school_shapefile",
  "Charter_Schools.shp"
)
charter_shp <- st_read(charter_file, quiet = TRUE) %>%
  filter(COUNTY == "Wake") %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%
  mutate(Type = "Public Charter")

# Combine them into one shapefile. This will duplicate some schools, but will
# add in some charters missing from the public file.
combined_shp <- rbind(
  public_shp %>% select(ID, school = SCHOOL_NAM, Type), 
  charter_shp %>% select(ID, school = SCHOOL, Type)
) %>%
  group_by(school) %>%
  mutate(count = seq(1, n())) %>%
  filter(count == 1)
latlong <- st_coordinates(combined_shp) %>%
  as.data.frame()
combined_shp$long <- latlong$X
combined_shp$lat <- latlong$Y

# Private shapefile
private_file <- here(
  "static", "data", "2019-11-15-picking-a-school", "nonpublic_school_shapefile",
  "NonPublic_Schools.shp"  
)
private_shp <- st_read(private_file, quiet = TRUE) %>%
  filter(County == "Wake") %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%
  mutate(Type = "Private")


```

```{r}
# Determine which schools include elementary grades
elementary_schools <- eog_tbl %>%
    filter(grade %in% paste(rep("Grade", 3), 3:5))
elementary_schools <- unique(elementary_schools$school)

# filter the EOG tables to just elementary schools in Wake County
eog_tbl_filtered <- eog_tbl %>%
  filter(
    district == "Wake County Schools" | school %in% charter_shp$SCHOOL,
    school %in% elementary_schools
  )
```

## Two main testing metrics

If you look at the [report cards](https://ncreportcards.ondemand.sas.com/src/?viewSelect=county&year=2018&type=Both&level=All&district=410&lng=en&currpage=1&county=wake) prepared for Wake County schools
by the State, you'll see that they each have two metrics.

  * A performance score
    * Measured by End of Grade tests (EOG)
    * Represented by the letter grade of the school.
  * A growth score
    * Measured by the Education Value-Added Assessment System (EVAAS)
    * Represented by the color of the school
    
I was familiar with the EOG tests. I took them as a kid, and it's a pretty
straight-forward measure to interpret. An "A" means that kids got a lot of
questions right and an "F" means they didn't.

The growth score was new to me, but given how prominent the color of the school
was compared to it's letter grade, it seemed important.

### Should I consider growth scores?

When I started, student growth seemed the most important factor. Consider two 
third grade teachers:

  * Teacher A:
    * Starts off with a class of children reading at a first grade level.
    * At year end, they are reading at a third grade level.
  * Teacher B:
    * Starts off with a class of children reading at a fourth grade level.
    * At year end, they are still reading at a fourth grade level.

Based on the EOG exam, Teacher B would look better because her children can read at
a fourth grade level. Looking at student growth would reveal that Teacher A
accomplished much more during the school year.

The goal of EVAAS and other [value-added
modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_modeling) is to isolate the
role of the teacher in a student's growth and control for things like
socio-economic status or previous competency level.

My first scatter plot of schools compared their EOG and growth scores. Along the
x-axis is the percent of students that scored above level four on the EOG
(College and Career Ready or CCR). The y-axis shows the growth index where
scores between -2 and 2 mean that students were learning at the expected rate.
Schools above 2 exceeded expectations while schools below 2 fell short.

```{r}
chart_eog <- eog_tbl_filtered %>%
  filter(
    subgroup == "All Students",
    grade == "All Subjects"
  )
chart_growth <- growth_tbl %>%
  filter(subgroup == "All Students", growth_type == "Overall")
chart_tbl <- chart_eog %>%
  left_join(
    chart_growth %>% select(district, school, growth_status, growth_index),
    by = c("district", "school")
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(growth_status))

# Estimate a simple linear model (removing some of the low outliers)
mod <- lm(
  growth_index ~ pct_4,
  data = chart_tbl %>%
    filter(growth_index > -7.07)
)
m <- coefficients(mod)["pct_4"]
b <- coefficients(mod)["(Intercept)"]
temp_df <- tibble(
  x = c(12, 92.7),
  y = m * x + b
)

p <- plot_ly() %>%
  add_trace(
    data = chart_tbl, x = ~pct_4, y = ~growth_index, type = "scatter",
    mode = "markers", text = ~school, color = ~growth_status
  ) %>%
  add_trace(
    data = temp_df, x = ~x, y = ~y, type = "scatter", mode = "lines",
    showlegend = FALSE, line = list(dash = "dash", color = "blue")
  ) %>%
  add_annotations( 
    text="Growth Target", xref="paper", yref="paper",
    x=1.0, xanchor="left",
    y=0.8, yanchor="bottom",    # Same y as legend below
    legendtitle=TRUE, showarrow=FALSE 
  ) %>%  
  layout(
    title = "Schools by EOG Level 4 and EVAAS Growth Index",
    yaxis = list(title = "Growth Index"),
    xaxis = list(title = "EOG CCR"),
    legend=list(y=0.8, yanchor="top" )
  )

p
```

There is a relationship between the two test scores (represented by the dashed
blue line), but it wasn't as strong as I expected. After digging through several
locations online, I was unable to get more than a general impression of how the
EVAAS scores were calculated. I was unable to find a statistical model or
documentation published by SAS (creators of EVAAS). I reached out to a teacher
friend of mine and quickly learned that I wasn't the only one. Teachers are in
the dark like everyone else, and they aren't happy about it.

Undocumented statistical models raise several flags. Perhaps there is validation
work I've not seen demonstrating that the models can be trusted, but I decided
to put more weight on the EOG scores and use the EVAAS system as a secondary
point of reference.

### Data on private schools

One thing I learned quickly was that the EOG and EVAAS scoring didn't apply to
private schools, which complicated the comparisons. The private schools I
contacted all used the [Iowa Test of Basic
Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Assessments) (ITBS). Some were more
forthcoming with their scores than others, but it made a systematic comparison
among private schools difficult. I also discovered the National Assessment of
Educational Progress ([NAEP](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/)), which is
administered to both private and public schools in 4<sup>th</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grades. Unfortunately, viewing data by
school is restricted.

## School demographics

The test scores above are for the school as a whole. Several studies, including
one using the NAEP data, suggest that achievement differences between schools
are due more to demographic differences than anything else
([link](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pubs/studies/2006461.asp)). This
means that understanding the makeup of schools is crucial. There are several
online sources that show the demographics of individual schools
([example](https://www.greatschools.org/)), but I found it useful to map the
data to see many at once.

### Race

The map below shows the racial composition of every public, public charter, and
private school in Wake County. Click on a pie chart to see the stats as well as
the school type.

```{r, race map}
colors <- brewer.pal(5, "Set1")
center <- get_center(public_demo_shp)

leaflet(width = "100%", options = leafletOptions(zoomControl = FALSE)) %>%
  addTiles(
    urlTemplate = 'https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png',
    attribution = '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attributions">CARTO</a>'
  ) %>%
  setView(center$long - 0.15, center$lat - 0.02, zoom = 12) %>%
  addMinicharts(
    public_private_demo_shp$long, public_private_demo_shp$lat,
    type = "pie",
    chartdata = public_private_demo_shp %>%
      as.data.frame() %>%
      select(Asian:White),
    popup = popupArgs(
      supValues = public_private_demo_shp %>%
        as.data.frame() %>%
        select(Type)
    ),
    colorPalette = colors,
    width = 25,
    layerId = public_private_demo_shp$school
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    data = public_private_demo_shp,
    label = public_private_demo_shp$school,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      noHide = T,
      textOnly = TRUE,
      textsize = "8px",
      direction = "top"
    ),
    radius = 1,
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0,
    group = "labels"
  )
```

### Free Lunch

The second map shows the proportion of students qualifying for free lunch. Note
that private schools are not included in this map.

```{r, lunch map}
colors <- brewer.pal(3, "Set2")

leaflet(width = "100%", options = leafletOptions(zoomControl = FALSE)) %>%
  addTiles(
    urlTemplate = 'https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png',
    attribution = '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attributions">CARTO</a>'
  ) %>%
  setView(center$long - 0.15, center$lat - 0.02, zoom = 12) %>%
  addMinicharts(
    public_demo_shp$long, public_demo_shp$lat,
    type = "pie",
    chartdata = public_demo_shp %>%
      as.data.frame() %>%
      select(`Free Lunch`, `Paid Lunch`),
    popup = popupArgs(
      supValues = public_demo_shp %>%
        as.data.frame() %>%
        select(Type)
    ),
    colorPalette = colors,
    width = 25,
    layerId = public_demo_shp$school
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    data = public_demo_shp,
    label = public_demo_shp$school,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      noHide = T,
      textOnly = TRUE,
      textsize = "8px",
      direction = "top"
    ),
    radius = 1,
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0,
    group = "labels"
  )
```

The schools were indeed very different, and that had to be taken into account
to make a fair comparison.

## Breaking down test scores

Before breaking down test scores further, I first narrowed the list of schools
to those near my home. While we could attend any charter or private school,
proximity makes the daily routine much more convenient and allows me to be more
active in the school.

These are the schools I investigated further:

  * Penny Road (public - our traditional calendar option)
  * Oak Grove (public - our year round option)
  * Peak Charter (public - charter)
  * Thales Academy (private)
  * Resurrection Lutheran (private)

### Public options

First, it seemed like a good idea to see where the public schools fell on the
scatter chart from earlier.

```{r}
local_public_schools <- c(
    "Peak Charter Academy",
    "Oak Grove Elementary",
    "Penny Road Elementary"
  )

local_tbl <- chart_tbl %>%
  filter(school %in% local_public_schools)

p %>%  
  add_annotations(
    data = local_tbl, x = ~pct_4, y = ~growth_index, text = ~school,
    ax = -10, ay = -20
  )
```

Peak Charter outperformed Penny Road and Oak Grove in both EOG and EVAAS scores.
Based on this plot (and my preference for EOG over EVAAS), my initial rankings
were:

  1. Peak Charter
  2. Penny Road
  3. Oak Grove

The chart below shows the EOG scores by school and subgroup. In short, every
subgroup scored better at Peak Charter except for white students. Further, the
difference in white students is small compared to how well they perform at all
three schools.

```{r}
chart_eog <- eog_tbl_filtered %>%
  filter(
    grade == "All Subjects"
  )
chart_growth <- growth_tbl %>%
  filter(growth_type == "Overall")
chart_tbl <- chart_eog %>%
  left_join(
    chart_growth %>%
      select(district, school, subgroup, growth_status, growth_index),
    by = c("district", "school", "subgroup")
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(growth_status))

subgroup_chart <- chart_tbl %>%
  filter(
    # subgroup %in% c("White", "Black", "Hispanic"),
    subgroup != "Academically or Intellectually Gifted",
    school %in% local_public_schools
  ) %>% mutate(
    subgroup = factor(
      subgroup,
      levels = c(
        "Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", "White",
        "English Learner", "Economically Disadvantaged",
        "Students With Disabilities", "All Students"
      )
    ),
    x_label = map_chr(school, function(x) word(x)[1])
  )

ggplot(data = subgroup_chart, aes(x = x_label, y = pct_4, fill = subgroup, label = pct_4)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(nudge_y = -3, size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(vars(subgroup), nrow = 2) +
  ggtitle("EOG Scores by Subgroup") +
  xlab("School") + 
  ylab("EOG CCR") +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

The second chart shows the EVAAS growth index broken down in the same manor.
While I decided to put less emphasis on it, it was worth a review, and Peak
was the clear winner here, too.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subgroup_chart, aes(x = x_label, y = growth_index, fill = subgroup, label = growth_index)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(nudge_y = ifelse(subgroup_chart$growth_index > 0, .5, -.5), size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(vars(subgroup), nrow = 2) +
  ggtitle("Growth Scores by Subgroup") +
  xlab("School") + 
  ylab("EVAAS Growth Index") +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```


### Private options

Thales provided their ITBS scores. Kindergartners scored better than 94% of the
students nationwide while fifth graders scored better than 82%. The decline was
concerning, but there are many potential explanations (e.g. new students
joining Thales in fifth grade).

Resurrection Lutheran did not provide detailed scores, but they did provide a
copy of their letter to parents from last year. Their students also did well,
with most classes scoring at 90% or above.

## Comparing public and private

The easy decision was to select Peak Charter Academy as our preferred public
school option. Of course, admission to Peak is done by lottery, so it isn't
guaranteed.

The hard part was to judge if the private schools were worth the money. It is
impossible to compare private to public directly given the different tests
used.

By researching the history of testing in NC, I realized the ITBS was used by
North Carolina until the 2001-2002 school year. Private schools are still
required to do yearly testing using national tests like ITBS.

> The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) will be eliminated from the North Carolina
state testing program beginning in the 2001-02 school year. The basis of this
decision by the North Carolina State Board of Education was two-fold: (1) to
allay public concern regarding excessive testing and (2) to accommodate pressing
budgetary constraints. ([source](http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/reporting/SOS/2001/Report.pdf))

Figure 13 from the same report shows the ITBS scores from 1996-2001.

![](/img/2019-11-15-picking-a-school/historical_nc_itbs_scores.png)

These scores weren't encouraging, but it's important to remember that they are
statewide scores. Based on my research, I expected the scores from Wake
County to be higher than the state average. I also expected Penny Road, Peak
Charter, and Oak Grove to be higher than the average for Wake County, but
guessing where they would score today was impossible.

The private schools had higher scores, but were skewed toward Asian and White
students, which are high-performing across the county. It was hard
to say how much of the ITBS scores were due to simple demographics.

## Conclusion

All in all, none of our schools look like bad options, and we will tour them
all. As of this moment, my top choice is Peak Charter. If we win the lottery, it
makes the decision easy. If we don't win, then deciding between Penny Road and
Resurrection Lutheran will be difficult. It will likely come down to culture,
personal preferences, and whether or not we can afford tuition.
